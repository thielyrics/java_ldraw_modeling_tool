# Project Overview

The LDraw format is widely used for creating and viewing stackable brick models. Unfortunately, none of the tools are in Java, which means that they tend to be either Windows or Mac specific. The goal of this project is to create a cross-platform LDraw modeling tool. Both the tool itself and the Java LDraw API are important results from this project. The tool should be designed to be easy for novice users to build a model. Hence, the interface should be striaghtforward and uncluttered.
Ideally, the tool will also include the ability to generate keyframe animations. The user would be able to set up a scene. After doing so, the user would move some of the models to create a second scene. Keyframing generates a sequence of intermediate steps between these frames to describe the animation.
